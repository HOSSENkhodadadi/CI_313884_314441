# Game Playing with Deep RL Agent README

This repository contains code for training and testing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play a game. The agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach to make intelligent decisions in the game environment.

## Overview

The provided code includes various components necessary for training and testing the Deep RL agent. Here's a brief overview of each component:

### 1. Generating Possible Moves

- The `get_possible_moves` function generates all possible moves given the current game board. These moves exclude already occupied elements.
- The function outputs a list of tuples, each containing a position and a move.

### 2. Output Classes

- The `classes` variable defines the output classes of the deep neural network. Each class represents a possible position in the game along with a corresponding action.

### 3. Deep RL Agent Definition

- The `ComplexDQN` class defines the architecture of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) used by the RL agent. It consists of fully connected layers.
- The `DeepRLPlayer` class implements the RL agent. It includes methods for making moves, training the agent, and storing experiences in memory.

### 4. Training Process

- The training process is implemented in the code block starting with `if __name__ == '__main__':`.
- The agent is trained over a specified number of episodes. After each episode, the agent's performance is evaluated, and it is trained using the experience gained.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Run all the notes except those that are mentioned not to be runned (they are required for testing mode).
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed, including PyTorch.
3. Execute the code snippets to train the Deep RL agent.
4. After training, load the trained model and test the agent's performance using the provided testing code.
5. Analyze the results to evaluate the agent's effectiveness in playing the game.

Feel free to customize the training parameters and game environment as needed for your specific use case.
